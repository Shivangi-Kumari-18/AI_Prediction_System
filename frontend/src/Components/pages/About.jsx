          <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Student Dropout Prediction System</strong> is an
            AI-powered solution that helps educational institutions identify
            students who are at risk of dropping out. By analyzing historical
            academic data, attendance records, and socio-economic factors, this
            system predicts the likelihood of student retention.

          <h2>ðŸ¤– How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            This system leverages <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> techniques to process
            student data and generate predictions. The model is trained using
            classification algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Random
            Forest, or Neural Networks) to ensure accurate forecasting.

          <p>
            By implementing this system, schools and colleges can{" "}
            <strong>proactively support students</strong>, improve success
            rates, and reduce dropout numbers. This not only benefits
            institutions but also contributes to a better future for students.
